Data Processing Pipeline (data_processing)

Link to web application deployed using Streamlit: https://share.streamlit.io/clafrance7/data_processing/main/main.py
This link goes to the Streamlit app which is streamed from this GitHub repository. 
This link will not work for the above purposes, and is only a demonstration of the app. 
The functional app is streamed on our local network for internal use. 

This is a program I wrote to automate all of the data processing and formatting that
I frequently do manually in Excel at work. It reads in testing data as a csv and formats the data
in a way that can be copy and pasted into GraphPad Prism for data analysis.
It also runs basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, and %CV) on replicate tests.
It detects shifts in the search window of the test strip reader to flag potential misreads or 
strip background artifacts.
Will also generate a document to archive strip images from the test strip reader.
